/*
 * KreppPlacer - C++ wrapper for krepp phylogenetic placement.
 *
 * krepp answers "where on this backbone tree does each read belong?" by
 * matching k-mers against a prebuilt index and maximising a pseudo-likelihood
 * over candidate edges.
 *
 * OWNERSHIP MODEL:
 * ===============
 * SharedKreppIndex holds the loaded index and the backbone tree. Both are
 * immutable once constructed and the query path only reads them, so a single
 * instance is shared by every thread rather than loaded per thread - indexes
 * routinely run to tens of gigabytes.
 *
 * KreppPlacer holds the per-thread scratch state and refers to the shared
 * index. Construct one per thread.
 *
 * Edge numbering follows the backbone tree. When the supplied Newick carries
 * jplace-style {N} decorations those numbers are reported verbatim, which is
 * what lets placements accumulate against a phylogeny whose edge IDs are
 * assigned elsewhere and must stay stable.

// is missing (:122-135), and never consults it for compatibility. The binary is
// mandatory - load_partial_index error_exits without it (:52-55) - it is what
// LSHF::check_compatible is fed from (:57-69), and the completeness check above
// already requires it, so a complete partial always has one. Reading the

// which mattered most for `w`: krepp compares m, h, k and the positions but
// never w (ext/krepp/src/lshf.cpp:159-163), so this is the only w check there
// is, and skipping it produced a wrong placement result with no error at all.
